 Description
=============
Fencing Scoring Machine/Box/Apparatus code for the arduino platform.
This project is an arduino based fencing scoring machine. It supports all 3
weaspons, foil, epee and sabre. The 2 fencers connect to the arduino and the
ground connected to the piste.


=====================
 Directory Structure
=====================
sw - Software, python code which communicates over the serial interface with the arduino

fw - Firmware, the code that runs on the arduino

hw - Hardware, the circuit designs around the arduino



=======================
 Hardware Requirements
=======================
1 Arduino Pro Micro/Pro Mini/Uno/Mega
6 resistors


=====================
 Percentage Complete
=====================
        
        85 %



=======
 TODOs
=======
1. Add support for the ground lights
2. Possibly use shit reg for lights
3. Add interrupts for buttons


=========
 Testing
=========
1. Connect up to a couple of fencers and test
2. Create a test arduino sketch to check that the timings (Lockout and depress)
   are correct


========================
 Extra features to add
========================
Add some kind of screen
Bluetooth for configuration
Connect to a network using the Ethernet shield (Not planning to do anytime soon)
USB interface to setup a laptop as the lights and scoring
